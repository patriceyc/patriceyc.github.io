  <h1>visualart</h1>
  <p>I grew up always trying to explore new creative mediums from canvas painting to photography and clay art everything was interesting to me. I continue to have an interest in always exploring new crafts to try out and inprove my skills. While it is sometimes hard to fint the time to do so I try to make it a priority since I feel it makes my quality of life better. This past month I participated in National Novel Writting Month and wrote 50,000 words over the month of November so I could challenge myself. It was difficult since I don't consider myself a writer but I completed it! Starting is always the hardest part and I hope to continue to improve on my writing skills. </p><br>

  <h2>Resin</h2>
  <p>Recently I have also tried making small dishes out of resin and made them to look like little duck ponds. They are not the best but these were some of the first I made and I hope to continue to improve.</p><br>

      <h2>Punchneedle</h2>
      <p>CUSTOM RUGS! Something I hope to start soon is punchneedling with the goal of eventually making a custom rug. I bought a kit to get started and had the idea of making little coasters to get the feel for it before I decided to move on to bigger projects like a rug.</p>

      <h2>Painting </h2>
      <p>I have not picked up a paintbrush in what feels like years. It is something that I hope I am able to do again soon and make time for. I would also like to work on my digital art skills from digital paining to design. </p>
